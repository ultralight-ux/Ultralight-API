///
/// Core renderer singleton for the library, coordinates all library functions.
/// 
/// The Renderer class is responsible for creating and painting View%s, managing Session%s, as well
/// as coordinating network requests, events, JavaScript execution, and more.
/// 
/// ## Creating the Renderer
///
/// @note A Renderer will be created for you automatically when you call App::Create() (access it
///       via App::renderer).
///
/// @note App::Create() is part of the AppCore API and automatically manages window creation, run
///       loop, input, painting, and most platform-specific functionality. (Available on desktop
///       platforms only)
/// \endparblock
///
/// ### Defining Platform Handlers
///
/// Before creating the Renderer, you should define your platform handlers via the Platform
/// singleton. This can be used to customize file loading, font loading, clipboard access, and other
/// functionality typically provided by the OS.
///
/// Default implementations for most platform handlers are available in the 
/// [AppCore repo](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/AppCore/tree/master/src). You can use these
/// stock implementations by copying the code into your project, or you can write your own.
///
/// At a minimum, you should provide a FileSystem and FontLoader otherwise Renderer creation will
/// fail.
///
/// ### Setting Up the Config
///
/// You can configure various library options by creating a Config object and passing it to
/// `Platform::instance().set_config()`.
/// 
/// ### Creating the Renderer
///
/// Once you've set up the Platform handlers and Config, you can create the Renderer by calling
/// `Renderer::Create()`. You should store the result in a RefPtr to keep it alive.
///
/// @par Example creation code
/// ```
///   // Get the Platform singleton (maintains global library state)
///   auto& platform = Platform::instance();
/// 
///   // Setup config
///   Config my_config;
///   platform.set_config(my_config);
/// 
///   // Create platform handlers (these are the minimum required)
///   // (This is pseudo-code, you will need to define your own)
///   MyFileSystem* file_system = new MyFileSystem();
///   MyFontLoader* font_loader = new MyFontLoader();
///   
///   // Setup platform handlers
///   platform.set_file_system(file_system);
///   platform.set_font_loader(font_loader);
/// 
///   // Create the Renderer
///   RefPtr<Renderer> renderer = Renderer::Create();
/// 
///   // Create Views here
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Updating Renderer Logic
/// 
/// You should call Renderer::Update() from your main update loop as often as possible to give the
/// library an opportunity to dispatch events and timers:
/// 
/// @par Example update code
/// ```
/// void mainLoop()
/// {
///   while(true)
///   {  
///     // Update program logic here
///     renderer.Update();
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Rendering Each Frame
/// 
/// When your program is ready to display a new frame (usually in synchrony with the monitor
/// refresh rate), you should call `Renderer::RefreshDisplay()` and `Renderer::Render()` so the
/// library can render all active View%s as needed.
/// 
/// @par Example per-frame render code
/// ```
/// void displayFrame()
/// {
///     // Notify the renderer that the main display has refreshed. This will update animations,
///     // smooth scroll, and window.requestAnimationFrame() for all Views matching the display id.
///     renderer.RefreshDisplay(0);
///
///     // Render all Views as needed
///     renderer.Render();
/// 
///     // Each View will render to a
///     //   - Pixel-Buffer Surface (View::surface())
///     //     or
///     //   - GPU texture (View::render_target())
///     // based on whether CPU or GPU rendering is used.
///     //
///     // You will need to display the image data here as needed.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
