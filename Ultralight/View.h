/// Web-page container rendered to an offscreen surface.
/// 
/// The View class is responsible for loading and rendering web-pages to an offscreen surface. It
/// is completely isolated from the OS windowing system, you must forward all input events to it
/// from your application.
///
/// ## Creating a View
///
/// You can create a View using Renderer::CreateView.
///
/// ```
///  // Create a ViewConfig with the desired settings
///  ViewConfig view_config;
///  
///  // Create a View, 500 by 500 pixels in size, using the default Session
///  RefPtr<View> view = renderer->CreateView(500, 500, view_config, nullptr);
/// ```
///
/// @note When using App::Create, the library will automatically create a View for you when you
///       call Overlay::Create.
///
/// ## Loading Content into a View
///
/// You can load content asynchronously into a View using View::LoadURL().
///
/// ```
///  // Load a URL into the View
///  view->LoadURL("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page");
/// ```
///
/// ### Local File URLs
///
/// Local file URLs (eg, `file:///page.html`) will be loaded via FileSystem. You can provide your
/// own FileSystem implementation so these files can be loaded from your application's resources.
///
/// ### Displaying Views in Your Application
///
/// Views are rendered either to a pixel-buffer (View::surface) or a GPU texture
/// (View::render_target) depending on whether CPU or GPU rendering is used (see
/// ViewConfig::is_accelerated).
///
/// You can use the Surface or RenderTarget to display the View in your application.
///
/// ```
///  // Get the Surface for the View (assuming CPU rendering)
///  Surface* surface = view->surface();
///
///  // Check if the Surface is dirty (pixels have changed)
///  if (!surface->dirty_bounds().IsEmpty()) {
///    // Cast to the default Surface implementation (BitmapSurface) and get
///    // the underlying Bitmap.
///    RefPtr<Bitmap> bitmap = static_cast<BitmapSurface*>(surface)->bitmap();
///
///    // Use the bitmap pixels here...
///
///    // Clear the dirty bounds after you're done displaying the pixels
///    surface->ClearDirtyBounds();
///  }
/// ```
///
/// ## Input Events
///
/// You must forward all input events to the View from your application. This includes keyboard,
/// mouse, and scroll events.
///
/// ```
///  // Forward a mouse-move event to the View
///  MouseEvent evt;
///  evt.type = MouseEvent::kType_MouseMoved;
///  evt.x = 100;
///  evt.y = 100;
///  evt.button = MouseEvent::kButton_None;
///  view->FireMouseEvent(evt);
/// ```
///
/// @note  The View API is not thread-safe, all calls must be made on the same thread that the
///        Renderer or App was created on.
