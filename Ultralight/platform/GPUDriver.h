/// View::render_target().
/// 
/// ## Default Implementation
///
/// A platform-specific implementation of GPUDriver is provided for you when you call App::Create(),
/// (currently D3D11, Metal, and OpenGL). We recommend using these classes as a starting point for
/// your own implementation (available open-source in the AppCore repository on GitHub).

/// ## Setting the GPU Driver
///
/// When using Renderer::Create(), you can provide your own implementation of this
/// class via Platform::set_gpu_driver().
///
/// ## State Synchronization
///
/// During each call to Renderer::Render(), the library will update the state of the GPU driver
/// (textures, render buffers, geometry, command lists, etc.) to match the current state of the
/// library.
///
/// ### Detecting State Changes
///
/// The library will call BeginSynchronize() before any state is updated and EndSynchronize() after
/// all state is updated. All `Create` / `Update` / `Destroy` calls will be made between these two
/// calls.
///
/// This allows the GPU driver implementation to prepare the GPU for any state changes.
/// 
/// ## Drawing
///
/// All drawing is done via command lists (UpdateCommandList()) to allow asynchronous execution
/// of commands on the GPU.
///
/// The library will dispatch a list of commands to the GPU driver during state synchronization. The
/// GPU driver implementation should periodically consume the command list and execute the commands
/// at an appropriate time.
