/// User-defined file system interface.
///
/// The library uses this to load file data (ie, raw file bytes) for a given file URL 
/// (eg, `file:///page.html`) .
///
/// You can provide the library with your own FileSystem implementation so that file data is
/// provided directly by your application (eg, from memory, from a virtual file system, etc).
/// 
/// ## Default Implementation
///
/// A platform-specific implementation of FileSystem is provided for you when you call
/// App::Create().
///
/// If you are using Renderer::Create(), you **must** provide your own. You can still use AppCore's
/// implementation however-- see the helper functions defined in <AppCore/Platform.h>.
///
/// ## Setting the File System
///
/// To provide your own custom FileSystem implementation, you should inherit from this class,
/// handle the virtual member functions, and then pass an instance of your class to
/// Platform::set_file_system() before calling Renderer::Create() or App::Create().
///

  ///       usually determined by analyzing the contents of the file.
  /// 
  /// @param  file_path  Relative file path (the string following the file:/// prefix)

  /// Open a file for reading and map it to a Buffer.

  /// To minimize copies, you should map the requested file into memory and use Buffer::Create()

  /// \parblock
  /// File data addresses returned from this function should generally be aligned to 16-byte
  /// boundaries (the default alignment on most operating systems-- if you're using C stdlib or
  /// C++ STL functions this is already handled for you).
  /// 
  /// This requirement is currently necessary when loading the ICU data file (eg, icudt67l.dat),
  /// and may be relaxed for  other files (but you may still see a performance benefit due to cache
  /// line alignment).
  /// 
  /// If you can't guarantee alignment or are unsure, you can use Buffer::CreateFromCopy to copy
  /// the file data content to an aligned block (at the expense of data duplication).
