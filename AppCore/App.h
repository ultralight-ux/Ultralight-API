/// The App class initializes the Platform singleton with OS-specific defaults, creates a Renderer,

/// ## Creating the App
///
/// Call App::Create() to initialize the library and create the App singleton.
///
/// ```
///   auto app = App::Create();

/// ## Creating a Window
///
/// Call Window::Create() to create one or more windows during the lifetime of your app.
///
/// ```
///   auto window = Window::Create(app->main_monitor(), 1024, 768, false, 
///                                kWindowFlags_Titled | kWindowFlags_Resizable);
/// ```

/// ### Creating an Overlay in a Window
///
/// Each Window can have one or more Overlay instances. Overlays are used to display web-based
/// content in a portion of the window.
///
/// Call Overlay::Create() to create an overlay in a window.
///
/// ```
///   auto overlay = Overlay::Create(window, 1024, 768, 0, 0);
/// ```
///
/// Each Overlay has a View instance that you can use to load web content into.
///
/// ```
///   overlay->view()->LoadURL("https://google.com");
/// ```
///
/// ## Running the App
///
/// Call App::Run() to start the main run loop.
///
/// ```
/// #include <AppCore/AppCore.h>
///
/// using namespace ultralight;
///
/// int main() {
///   // Initialize app, window, overlay, etc. here...
///
///   app->Run();
///
///   return 0;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Shutting Down the App
///
/// Call App::Quit() to stop the main run loop and shut down the app.
///
/// ```
///   app->Quit();
/// ```

/// @note  This is optional, you can use the Renderer class directly if you want to manage your
///        own windows and run loop.
